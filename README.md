## 🛒 Shopping List

A simple Shopping List application built with React to practice the fundamentals of state management, custom hooks, and context.
This project was created as part of a hands-on learning journey to build interactive and practical applications while improving code structure and reusability.

## 🧩 Features

> ➕ Add new grocery items with name and quantity

> 📝 Edit or update existing items directly in the list

> ✅ Mark items as checked when purchased

> 🗑️ Delete individual items or clear the entire list

> 🔍 Search for items dynamically using global state

> 🧠 Persistent data using LocalStorage

> ⚙️ Sorting items by input order, name, or checked status

> 💻 Clean and responsive layout built with CSS

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

> ⚛️ React 18+ — component-based UI

> 🧠 Context + useReducer — global state management

> 💅 CSS — styling the layout and components

> ⚡ Vite — fast and modern development environment

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Framzy/React-Shopping-List.git
cd React-Shopping-List
```

Install dependencies:

```cmd
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```cmd
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:

👉 [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- This project helped me deepen my understanding of core React concepts such as:

- Managing complex state using useReducer

- Sharing data globally through React Context

- Creating custom hooks for cleaner logic separation

- Using useEffect for LocalStorage synchronization

- Applying useMemo for optimized filtering and sorting

- Handling form input and conditional rendering

- Maintaining data immutability for predictable state updates

## 💡 Future Improvements

Here are some possible enhancements to take this project further:

> 🌗 Add Dark Mode toggle

> 📱 Improve mobile responsiveness

> 📦 Add category or price input per item

> 🔔 Add reminders or notifications for pending items

> 🗃️ Store data using an external API or backend (e.g. Firebase or Supabase)

> 🎨 Polish UI with Tailwind CSS or Framer Motion animations

## 🏁 Summary

The React Shopping List demonstrates practical use of React Context, hooks, and reducer logic in a real-world mini app.
It’s simple, fast, and scalable — a perfect base for further experimentation and learning in front-end development.
